#Advantages of Tuple over List
#Since tuples are quite similar to lists, both of them are used in similar situations. However, there are certain advantages of implementing a tuple over a list. Below listed are some of the main advantages:

#We generally use tuples for heterogeneous (different) data types and lists for homogeneous (similar) data types.
#Since tuples are immutable, iterating through a tuple is faster than with list. So there is a slight performance boost.
#Tuples that contain immutable elements can be used as a key for a dictionary. With lists, this is not possible.
#If you have data that doesn't change, implementing it as tuple will guarantee that it remains write-protected.
